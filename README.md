# leaderboard
Leaderboard Microservice which implements standalone leaderboard service
inspeire by
[Redis Sorted Sets](https://redis.io/topics/data-types).

Many leaderboard implementation make use of the general Sorted Set operations
in [Redis](https://redis.io/) such as [ZADD](https://redis.io/commands/zadd),
[ZRANK](https://redis.io/commands/zrank), [ZRANGE](https://redis.io/commands/zrange),
etc. This project is an academic excercise which attempts to improve on some
of the restrictions of Redis, while maintaining the robustness of it.
Academically, it is also an exercercise in designing and implementing a
microservice, and experimenting with modern cloud principles.

# Redis Limitations

## Scores

64-bit [floating point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic)
numbers are used to represent scores in sorted sets. However, the mantissa
is only 52 bits, so integers requiring clost to or more than 52 bits
cannot be represented precicely, so it becomes impossible to compare
scores correctly.

This implementqation uses Big Integers where is this no practical upper
bound on the number of bits needed to represent an Integer.

Integers are used as they are simpler, and it's hard to make an argument
where fractional scores are need.


## Tie Breaking

In Redis sorted sets, tie breaking is based on the lexical ordering of
the member keys. This is not exactly fair as members with some lexical
orderings will alway wing over other members in a tie.

Some leaderboard implementations (sometimes based in Redis) also track
of the time the score was set/incremented. The tie favors either early
or late scores. When scaling out a leaderboard across multiple nodes,
the clocks will not be perfectly in sync. Other techniques, such as
GUID/UUID suffer similar fairness issues.

This implimentation is based on random numbers, which are generally
fair across multiple nodes.

# Architecture

## Akka

Akka is used as it's a fairly effective way to implement
[Reactive](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org) applications.

## Akka Cluster

Akka Cluster is used for the implementation, where the microservice may
comprise one or more nodes. In a multinode deployment, each node
represents the same data, with eventual consistency.

## Akka Typed

Akka Typed was used as both a learning experience, and a belief this
is a better way to do actors anyway.

## Scala

Scala is used as the programming language as Lightbend tend to give better
support for Scala than Java.

## Scoring

Scoring is implemented by a combination of
[TrieMap](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.12.3/scala/collection/concurrent/TrieMap.html)
and
[ConcurrentSkipListMap](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentSkipListMap.html),
both of which are non-blocking concurrent data structures. This is so
the implementation can 'scale up' simply by adding more cores and/or
hardware threads to a given node (JVM).

### Assumptions

It is assumed that updates for the same member are not likely to
conflict in real time, while non-members are very likely to conflict.

## Concurrency

At the lowest level, thread safe concurrency is handled by using
concurrent data structures. These are supported in the Java Virtal
Machine (JVM) using hardware support such as
[Test And Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-and-set),
[Compare And Swap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap),
and similar instructions.

### Scorekeeping Spinlock

At the heart of scorekeeping two concurrent data structures need to
be updated free of race condictions. In this case a critical section
is protected with a
[Spinlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap)
to avoid
[Java Synchronization](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/sync.html)
or actors. It has not been tested whether this is still a better design
choice, only a hunch.

Java syncronization was ruled out in that the thread blocks, and overall
blocking operations are to be avoided in a
[Reactive](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org)
design. On the other hand, the spinlock wastes time calling
`Thread.yield` which essentially blocks the thread as well.

A scorekeeping actor was ruled out, as then only one thread can keep
score, which limits scalability.




# Benchmarks

The reported benchmarks are based on a Xeon 5560 @ 3.33 GHz, with 6
cores and 12 hardware threads (or logical processors), 24 GB RAM,
running under Windows 10, with Java 8.

## Transactions Per Second

### Single Member

This is a synthetic benchmark in that the scenario is highly unlikely
in a real world applications. Basically, the score for a single member
is updated as quickly as possible from as many hardware threads as
possible.

On order of 200,000 TPS was achieved, as was a high level of
contention on the data structures. While the underlying data structures
are [TrieMap](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.12.3/scala/collection/concurrent/TrieMap.html)
and [ConcurrentSkipListMap](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentSkipListMap.html),
which are both thread safe, they must be updated together. To heep the
operation threadsafe, a simple spin-lock is used. The lock part of the
spin is based on the characteristics of the TriMap.

A critical factor in spinning is wasting time in the spin. Initially
a simple call to `Thread.yield` was used, but led to too much
contention, where a single transaction may spin more than 200 times
while waiting for other transactions to complete.

Eventually

    for (i <- -1 to spinCount * spinCount) Thread.`yield`

seemed to yield the best results.

Under the achieved load, a single transaction may spin more than 30
times while waiting for other transactions to complete, for over 15 ms.

The actual spin is done using Scala tail recursion, and there are many
factors that can affect the spin.

Nonetheless, as this is a synthetic benchmark, this amount of contention
is not expected under normal conditions. The portion of time in spin
wait can be 80%

The original motivation for this test was to break concurrency
garantees, which found problems in early implemention. For now,
the code seems fairly thread safe, and this benchmark helped
troubleshoot some initial defects.

### Multiple Member

This a more realistic benchmark where multiple randome members are
updated concurrently. It is still relatively synthetic in that the
scorekeeping is hit as hard as possible.

On order of 300,000 TPS was achieved, and as expected, less contention
on the data structures.

What was not expected was higher contention on some members than the
single member case. See also
[Can anyone explain interesting spin-lock behavior?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50193107/can-anyone-explain-interesting-spin-lock-behavior)
The was mostly resolved by using exponential-backog in the spin wait.

Under the achieved load, a single transaction can still spin more than
30 times, but this is much less likely, where the average is less then
10 times. The portion of spin wait is typically less than 10%, which is
expected, and much better than 80% above. Under less load, contenction
is expected to me much less as well.
