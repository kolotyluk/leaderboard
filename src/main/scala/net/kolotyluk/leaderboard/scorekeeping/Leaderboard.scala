/** =Leaderboard Score Keeping=
  * <p>
  * Keep track of leaderboard scores.
  * <p>
  * ==Redis==
  * Many leaderboard implementations use Redis Sorted Sets for keeping track of scores. In general
  * this is an excellent way to implement a leaderboard, but there are some issues with this.
  * ===Floating Point Scores===
  * Redis uses a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format 64-bit floating point number]]
  * for scores. The main problem with this is that this
  * puts an upper limit on scorekeeping because beyond 52 bits of precision, it is no longer possible
  * to distinguish unique scores. This implementation uses BigInt, which has infinite precision, so
  * there are no bounds on how high (or low) scores can get.
  * ===Tie Breaking===
  * The next problem is tie-breaking, which relies on the lexical ordering of member IDs. This is
  * intrinsically unfair because it means the same members will alway win in a tie-breaking situation.
  * Instead, tie-breaking here is done based on random numbers, such that the largest random number
  * breaks the tie.
  * ==Random Numbers==
  * Timestamps, UUIDs, and other methods were considered for tie-breaking, but this design allows
  * for multiple ScoreKeepers on multiple Akka Cluster Nodes, and timestamps and UUIDs would lead
  * to different nodes giving tie-breaking preference over other nodes. Random numbers are 64-bits,
  * so there is a 1 in 2^64^ chance of a collision, and a failed tie breaking. Random seeds are
  * created by calling System.nanoTime each time a new random number is generated.
  * <p>
  * =Threadsafe=
  * This code is intended to be threadsafe, using concurrent non-blocking data structures, in order
  * to offer better performance over serialization in a single actor.
