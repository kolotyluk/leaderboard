    * that us the lexical ordering of the members to break ties, this is not really fair in a competition.
    * Basically, the ties will always be broken in favor of the lexical ordering of the member ID. Some Redis
    * leaderboard implementations us the update time to break ties, where either the first or last member
    * update wins in the tie. While this is valid, if the leaderboard service is split across multiple
    * runtimes, especially on different systems, the clock skew could unfairly bias the tie breaking.
    * Similarly, GUIDs or UUIDs are not fairly distributed.
